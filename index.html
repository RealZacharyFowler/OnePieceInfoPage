                <p>Despite their small size, the Straw Hats are an extremely diverse group possessing a large variety of backgrounds. Their members' origins range from ordinary islanders and workers to bounty hunters, royalty, criminal gang members, and veteran pirates</p>
                <p>Despite having a small number of members, the Straw Hats are an extremely powerful crew with great potential, as stated by Kuzan when he first met them, eventually growing to the point of being capable of challenging and surpassing Warlord organizations like Baroque Works,[13] the Thriller Bark Pirates, and the Donquixote Pirates,[32] and later crews captained by the Four Emperors like the Beasts Pirates and Big Mom Pirates. As their captain Monkey D. Luffy is now an Emperor, they are recognized as one of the four strongest pirate crews in the world.[17] It should be noted that this accomplishment, level of strength and infamy has been achieved in just over 2 years from the start of their voyage.</p>
                <p>One of the most prominent testaments to their strength is that they are the only known crew where every single member has a bounty on their head. The Straw Hats' combined bounties across their ten members equal Beli8,816,001,000, proving how dangerous the World Government sees them.</p>

                <h3>Monkey D. Luffy</h3>
                <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[10] is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters.[26][27] He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King,[28] which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers, and crew.[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[31]
                    Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army,[32] and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[33] and their family carries the initial and Will of D. At age 7, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which turned his body into rubber.[34] Shanks also gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he became a great pirate.[35] Growing up on Dawn Island under the care of Curly Dadan,[36] Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace[37] and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo.</p>
